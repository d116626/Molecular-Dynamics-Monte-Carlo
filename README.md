# Molecular-Dynamics-Monte-Carlo
In this work we will try to observe the liquid-solid phase transition using rigid disk systems. The system was simulated using three different methods: Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo Direct Sampling and Monte Carlo Sampling-Markov Chain. By simulating the latter method with periodic boundary conditions, we observe a liquid-solid phase transition.
